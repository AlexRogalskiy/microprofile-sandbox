[[introduction]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The proposal introduces APIs for obtaining CompletableFutures that are
backed by managed threads (threads that are managed by the container),
with the ability to capture context from the thread that creates the
CompletableFuture and apply it when running the CompletionStage action.

[[motivation]]
Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

When using a reactive model with dependent stages which execute upon
completion or prior stages, the context under which dependent stages
execute is unpredictable.  Dependent stages might run with the
context of a thread that awaits completion, or the context of a
previous stage that completed and triggered the dependent stage,
or with no/undefined context at all.  Existing solutions for
transferring thread context, such as the EE Concurrency Utilities
ContextService, are difficult to use and require a lot of boilerplate
code.  This spec makes it possible for thread context propagation to
easily be done in a type-safe way, keeping boilerplate code to a
minimum, as well as allowing for thread context propagation to be
done automatically when using a CompletableFuture.

It is also important that CompletableFutures and their dependent
stages, and dependent stages created by those stages, and so on,
all run on threads that are known by the container and properly
managed by it.  This spec makes it possible to do so by providing
an API by which the user obtains managed CompletableFuture instances
from a managed executor.

The above are proposed to be addressed within EE Concurrency under
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/concurrency-api/issues/40[EE Concurrency Issue 40],
however, it will be a while before Jakarta EE specs are able to
make progress, leading us to address this first in MicroProfile.

Goals

* Proper management of CompletableFuture threads by the container.
* Mechanism for thread context propagation to CompletableFuture
actions that reduces the need for boilerplate code.
* Full compatibility with EE Concurrency spec, such that proposed
interfaces can eventually be seamlessly merged into EE Concurrency.

[[proposed-solution]]
Proposed solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This spec introduces two interfaces that contain methods that we
hope will eventually be added to Jakarta EE Concurrency.

The interface, org.eclipse.microprofile.concurrent.ManagedExecutor,
provides methods for obtaining managed instances of CompletableFuture
which are backed by the managed executor as the default asynchronous
execution facility and the default mechanism of defining thread
context propagation. Similar to EE Concurrency's
ManagedExecutorService, the MicroProfile ManagedExecutor also
implements the Java SE java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService interface,
using managed threads when asynchronous invocation is required
and disallowing the same life cycle methods as ManagedExecutorService.
It is intended that ManagedExecutor methods will one day be added
to ManagedExecutorService, and for a single implementation to be
capable of simultaneously implementing both interfaces, both
currently as well as after adoption into Jakarta EE.

A second interface, org.eclipse.microprofile.concurrent.ThreadContext,
provides methods for individually contextualizing dependent stage
actions. This gives the user more fine-grained control over the
capture and propagation of thread context.
It is intended that ThreadContext methods will one day be added to
EE Concurrency's ContextService. and for a single implementation to
be capable of simultaneously implementing both interfaces, both
currently as well as after adoption into Jakarta EE.

[[injection]]
Injection
^^^^^^^^^

It shall be possible to inject instances of ManagedExecutor and
ThreadContext via the `@Inject` annotation, for example:

[source,java]
----
  @Inject ManagedExecutor executor;
  @Inject ThreadContext threadContext;
  ...
  CompletableFuture<Integer> stage = executor
      .supplyAsync(supplier1)
      .thenApplyAsync(function1)
      .thenApply(function2)
      .thenApply(threadContext.withCurrentContext(function3));
----

The container provides default instances of ManagedExecutor and
ThreadContext, which are injected above.

It still needs to be discussed how the spec will allow for
instances other than the default to be configured.

[[spi-for-context-providers]]
SPI for Thread Context Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Needs discussion whether the spec will standardize an SPI for
thread context providers.

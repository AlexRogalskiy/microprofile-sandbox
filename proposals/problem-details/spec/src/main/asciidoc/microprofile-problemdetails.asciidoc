== Introduction

* MUST `application/problem+json`, `application/problem+xml`; SHOULD any, e.g. `+yaml`
* SHOULD render `text/html`
* map also `@Valid` REST params
* logging: 4xx = DEBUG, 5xx = ERROR; configurable?
* order of extensions is alphabetic (which is better for tests than random)
* multiple extensions with the same name: undefined behavior
* JAXB can't unmarshal a subclass with the same type and namespace

* Security considerations: nothing dangerous in problem details (i.e. exception message); stack-trace in logs
